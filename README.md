- 👋 Hi, I’m @algozine - Professional Lecturer of IS at Marist College
- 👀 I’m interested in teaching team-based and project-based classes where students must collaborate on coding projects that aren't the 'normal' college projects.
- 🚧 What types of projects do I prefer you ask? Projects that are for non-profits in the local community, serve the community for family run businesses, and usually projects that don't allow students to just start from scratch > they must inherit code from a prior class AND improve it
- 🌱 I’m currently learning new and different pedagogical approaches to team-based teaching, whereby you partner with an instructor from another discipline to teach your students
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with instructors who are better at writing papers than me - I worked in corporate most of my career, so writing and publishing academic papers isn't something I'm knowlegable about
- 📫 How to reach me > christopher.algozzine@marist.edu
